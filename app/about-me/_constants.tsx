          I was born in 1994 with the name Paolo Vincent Julian, and
          I had an awesome childhood in Baguio City, Philippines.
          The weather there was always cool, which was pretty
          amazing! As a kid, I was totally into Math, just like
          solving the most complex equations was my superpower. I
          was also captivated by epic anime series like "Flame of
          Recca," "Ghost Fighter," and of course, "Naruto." Those
          shows fueled my imagination with their thrilling
          adventures and awesome battles.
        `}

        {`
          But it wasn't just anime that shaped my interests. Epic
          movies like "The Lord of the Rings" and "The Matrix" had a
          profound impact on me. These films fueled my curiosity
          about the blend of fantasy, technology, and hacking. I
          mean, who could forget the iconic code animations from
          "The Matrix"? They were beyond cool, more like
          mind-blowingly awesome, and I'd be lying if I said they
          didn't play a big part in inspiring me to become a
          programmer. üåüüíªüòé

        I was always the top student during my elementary days. I dedicated a
        lot of time to studying and didn't have much time to play games.
        However, when I entered high school, I gained more freedom and became
        addicted to playing video games, particularly StarCraft and Dota. As a
        result, my grades dropped significantly, and I experienced burnout from
        studying. Nevertheless, I managed to pass high school without
        encountering many academic problems.

        When I first stepped into college, I was totally unsure about what to
        study. The whole Information Technology (I.T) and Computer Science thing
        hadn't even crossed my mind, because I was pretty much fixated on video
        games. That's where my head was at most of the time. My dad suggested I
        give Electronic and Communications Engineering a shot, pointing out the
        potential fat paycheck and my knack for math.
        `}
        <br />
        <br />
        {`
        But here's the kicker: I wasn't feeling it. I ended up dropping most of
        my classes, except for one glimmer of hope ‚Äì a computer-related course
        that covered stuff like Entity Relationship Diagrams (ERD) and the
        basics of programming. It was like a lightbulb moment üí°. I realized
        that I'd always had a thing for programming.
        `}
        <br />
        <br />
        {`
        So, I decided to make a switch and moved to a different school that
        focuses Information Technology and Computer Science. I opted for a major
        of Network Security because, well, hacking sounded pretty cool back then
        üòé.

        I started to ace all the computer-related subjects and things were
        looking up. But, the real revelation hit me during my On-the-Job
        Training (OJT). Network security, as it turned out, wasn't my jam. But I
        was also pretty darn good at it. In fact, they even wanted me to stick
        around after my OJT was done. The thing is, as much as I excelled at it,
        I just wasn't feeling it.

        So, I dove into self-study mode and spent a month mastering web
        development. Thanks to some hard work and dedication, I snagged a gig as
        a Junior Application Developer. That's where I am now, living the dream,
        doing what I love, and coding away with a big grin on my face! üñ•Ô∏èüíª

        excitement, ‚Äúover-engineered‚Äù stuff and a pinch of 'I-know-it-all'
        attitude. Little did I know that this was the start of something
        wonderful. Working with an incredible team, we laughed through long
        hours and learned together. During this phase, I accumulated invaluable
        experience, particularly when I ventured into pioneering the development
        of single-page applications using Vue JS, at a time when it was still a
        relatively new technology.

        In 2019, after a short break to visit my mother in the Cayman Islands
        and tour Singapore for two months, I joined YNS Philippines Inc as a
        Software Engineer. In this role, I had a fantastic mentor who believed
        in keeping things simple and practical. He was a genius, and he inspired
        me to embrace a simpler lifestyle. Apart from that, I learned about

        technologies like TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, Server-Side Rendering,
        Static Site Generation, and mono-repo structures. These additions
        represent the modern approach to web development, and I'm excited to

        In 2023, as much as I'd like to continue at Yondu, they were
        transitioning back to office work, which posed challenges for me. While
        exploring job opportunities, I found that the average salary for
        engineers was higher, almost double my current income. I promptly
        applied for a position at Accelo, and I can confidently say that
        everything here is outstanding! The team is passionate, everyone works
        with a smile, and they're incredibly approachable. The codebase is
        well-maintained and unit-tested, code reviews are thorough, and
        everything is meticulously planned. Plus, it's entirely remote, which is
        a perfect fit for me. As of writing this article in October 2022, I'm in
        my first month at Accelo, and it seems like I won't be jumping companies
        again because I love it here.
